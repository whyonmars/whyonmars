Watching Jimmy Kimmel's show and the celebrities that gets invited into the show, or however way that works, a question popped into my mind. Why do we clap when we are impressed about something, some event, or someone's actions?

Looking at the mechanical action of hitting the palms of the hands against each other look ridiculous without context. However, to someone on the receiving end of such ridiculous-looking action, it signifies that he is under the spotlight. If not for a brief moment, they are at the center of the universe.

For the majority of the civilized world, clapping is almost synonymous to applause, to a recognition of an outstanding performance. It is not something that is thought about as to why someone claps. What then does this tell us about the extent to which humans are heavily influenced by the society one moves in? When did this idea of clapping started? Why does clapping produce a high frequency sound compared to hitting other parts of the arms together? Why is that brief moment of applause in the form of clapping sought after by a many people?
