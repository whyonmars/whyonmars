Why on Mars? Why not on Jupiter? Or Saturn? Or Pluto? Of all the planets, why on our fear-inducing red neighbor? Why should we even look for other planets to ultimately live on? What can we get out of this expedition towards an alien planet?

The answers to these questions could be obvious to a lot of people. For a start, it is planet nearest to use that isn't as scorching as Venus. This limitation in choices is hindered by the technology man is capable of producing. But why should we even try?

Rarely are the answers sufficient enough to provide a great understanding of the bigger picture that is greater than the lenses by which we see the world through. It is of no doubt that satiating questions is extremely easy and convenient now that walking a few steps to the bathroom takes more effort than typing in your question in Google's search box. On my behalf, I do stop at the first link, read what it says and go into the illusion of understanding, only to  realize that I really have not gained anything at all the moment I close the window and go about my daily activities.

Maybe the certainty of knowing that you know something about anything at all is comforting for some, if not most but for me, I would rather know that I don't know than to think that I know when I don't know. With that comes the value of questioning the obvious, asking even the 'dumb' questions when you are truly confused, not biting into the assumption that you know that thus, need not ask.
