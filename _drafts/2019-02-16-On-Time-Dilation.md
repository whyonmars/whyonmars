I have always been fascinated by the thought experiments of Einstein. He has come up with grand theories that have been considered revolutionary in what we know about the world today, and thus in scientific communities. However, I have doubts upon the methods that Einstein have employed in order to come up with the grand theories that he has come up. To use of his thought experiments in my own words

> The Twin Paradox. Imagine that a person and his twin sister are on a train station. The person(male)'s twin sister boards the train that travels at the speed of light. Now, imagine a clock on the floor of the train and a clock on the ceiling of the train. Each one of them are directly opposite each other. Imagine a light bouncing between the two clocks. The twin sister would see the light going straight up and down. Consider the train to have a glass exterior and thus, observers from outside would be able to see the interior of the train. For the twin brother, he would see the light travel in a diagonal path forming a zigzag, different from the perception of the twin sister aboard the train. This would further elicit the idea that light from the observer on the platform, at rest relative to the train would see that time travels slower compared to an observer aboard the train.

This idea is really fascinating but I doubt the integrity of the method of using the thought experiment. The question of the actual outcomes of the experiment is put into question. Maybe the idea is to test a theory that is by no means physically possible as of the present day technology. I don't know much about the thought experiments and Einstein's methods but there must be a proof beyond the thought experiment that further supports his theory, so much so that the scientific community accepts it. Maybe this is just my ignorance but I don't really know.

nice one
